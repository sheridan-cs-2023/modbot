# ModBot

ModBot is a Discord bot programmed in python for the Sheridan CS Class of 2023 Discord server.

Any member of the server is welcome to message me on Discord to request membership to the
[CS 2023 GitHub Organization](https://github.com/sheridan-cs-2023/), which will allow them to
contribute code!

This server, which starts off in `bot.py`, is designed to be easy for newcomers to programming,
with plenty of explanatory comments.
